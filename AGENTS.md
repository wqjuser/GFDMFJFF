# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/extension.ts` is the main VS Code extension entry point and command handler.
- `out/` is the compiled JavaScript output generated by TypeScript.
- `package.json` is the extension manifest (commands, activation events, scripts).
- `tsconfig.json` controls TypeScript compilation; `.vscodeignore` shapes the VSIX package.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run compile` �� compile `src/` to `out/` with `tsc`.
- `npm run watch` �� rebuild on changes during development.
- `npm run vscode:prepublish` �� build step used before packaging/publishing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language is TypeScript; follow the existing 2-space indentation and single-quote string style in `src/extension.ts`.
- Use `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for types/interfaces, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Keep command IDs and activation events in `package.json` synchronized with the implementation.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests are configured in this repository. If you add tests, document the runner and add a script (e.g., `npm test`).
- Name test files consistently and keep them in a dedicated `test/` or similar folder.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- No Git history is present in this workspace, so no convention is enforced. Prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- PRs should include a concise summary, verification steps (such as `npm run compile`), and any behavior or UX notes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Avoid committing secrets or publisher credentials; keep `package.json` metadata accurate.
- Ensure `out/` is rebuilt from `src/` before publishing a VSIX.
